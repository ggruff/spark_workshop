# Spark Workshop 

This workshop will teach you some basic Spark operations that can be used to do simple outlier detection. The example dataset we will use is the Amazon Electronics review (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).

## Installation instructions
To make things easier and avoid installation woes, I created a Docker container that will have all we need for this workshop. Please follow the instructions below to start up the container:

1. Install Docker. On Mac OS X, you can download [Docker for Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) for an easy-to-install desktop app. 

2. Download the .zip file linked here: https://github.com/stefano-meschiari/spark_workshop/archive/master.zip

3. Run `run.sh` to start the Docker container.

4. You should be able to navigate to `localhost:8888` with your browser and see a Jupyter notebook instance. The password is `spark`.
